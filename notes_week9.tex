These notes cover Robert Harper's lectures on Homotopy Type Theory from
November 11 and 13, 2013. Discussions include Hedberg's theorem, propositional truncation,
and ...


\section{Refresher: Sets and Propositions}
Recall from previous lectures the definitions of sets and propositions within HoTT.
A type is called a set if there is only ``one way'' for any two of its elements to be equal:
$$ \isSet(A) \defeq \prod_{x,y:A}\prod_{p,q: x=_Ay}(p=_{x=_A y}q) $$

Relatedly, a type is called a proposition if it is a ``subsingleton'': that is, it has at most one inhabitant.
$$ \isProp(A) \defeq \prod_{x,y:A}(x=_A y) $$

We can define $\isSet$ in terms of $\isProp$: a type is a set if equality for that type is propositional.
$$ \isSet(A) \equiv \prod_{x,y:A}\isProp(x=_A y) $$

What it means for a type to be a set is that there are no nontrivial relationships between 
elements of the type. The higher homotopy structure we have seen in previous weeks does not exist
in a set, as the only paths between elements are trivial, which trivializes the higher structure.
In this sense, sets (and propositions) ``reclaim'' some properties of classical mathematics.
%: for instance, $\isProp(A)\to\neg\neg A\to A$. (True?)

\begin{proposition}
 For any type $A$, we have $\isProp(\neg A)$, where $\neg A\defeq A\to \zero$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
 We want to find $$\_:\prod_{x,y:\neg A}(x=_{\neg A} y).$$ Since $\neg A$ is a function type, 
 via $\funext$ it suffices to find $$\_:\prod_{u: A}(x(u) =_\zero y(u)).$$ 
 We have $\lambda u.\, \abort{x(u)=_\zero y(u)}(x(u))$ of this type.
 %Where in notes was abort defined? I can't find it.
\end{proof}

From this, we can derive the (perhaps surprising) result that $\neg\neg (\neg A)\to \neg A$,
even though we do not necessarily have $\neg\neg A \to A$.

\section{Hedberg's Theorem}
These considerations lead us to the following important theorem.

\begin{defn}
 A type $A$ has \emph{decidable equality} if one can prove of any two inhabitants of $A$ 
 that they are either equal or unequal.
 $$\prod_{x,y:A}(\Id{A}(x,y)\vee \neg \Id{A}(x,y)).$$
 
 A type $A$ has \emph{stable equality} if double-negation elimination holds in its identity type:
 $$\prod_{x,y:A}(\neg\neg \Id{A}(x,y)\to \Id{A}(x,y))$$
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}
 A type with decidable equality is a set.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
 
 The proof of Hedberg's theorem goes in two parts:
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Decidable equality implies stable equality. In fact, we can prove in general that for 
  any type $A$, $(A+\neg A)\to \neg\neg A \to A$. This part is simple and left as an exercise.
  
  \item Stable equality implies sethood. This is the heart of Hedberg's theorem.
 \end{enumerate}
 
 We prove 2. Suppose $h:\prod x,y:A.(\neg \neg x=_A y)\to (x=_Ay)$ is evidence
 that equality in $A$ is stable.  To show $\isSet(A)$, is suffices to show that
 $x:A, p:x=_A x\entails p=_{x=_A x} \refl{A}(x)$, since we can reduce the
 identity of $p,q:x=_A y$ to showing that $p \concat q^{-1} = \refl{A}(x)$.
 
 Fix $x:A$. We then have $h(x):\prod y:A.(\neg\neg x=_A y)\to(x=_A y)$.
 
 Using dependent function application $\apd$ (defined previously), we see that
 $$\apd_{h(x)}(p): p_*(h(x)(x))=_{(\neg\neg x=_A x)\to(x=_A x)}h(x)(x)$$

 By lemma 2.9.6 of~\cite{HoTTBook2013}, it follows that for that for any $r:\neg\neg(x=_A x)$,
 $$ p_*(h(x)(x))(r)=_{x=_A x} h(x)(x)(p_* r). $$

 Next, from a proven property of transport in identity types, we have that
 $$ p_*(h(x)(x))(r) =_{x=_A x} h(x)(x)(r)\cdot p $$ % This shouldn't be definitional, is it?
 and because negated types are propositions (from above),
 $$ h(x)(x)(p_* r) =_{x=_A x} h(x)(x)(r)$$
 so we have by transitivity
 $$ h(x)(x)(r)\cdot p =_{x=_A x} h(x)(x)(r) $$
 and cancellation gives us $p =_{x=_A x} \refl{A}(x)$ as desired.
\end{proof}

For an example of the power of Hedberg's theorem, note that it implies $\isSet(\Nat)$.
Using double induction, one can show 
$$\prod_{x,y:\Nat}(x=_\Nat y)\vee \neg (x=_\Nat y).$$ This is left as an exercise.

\section{More Results on Propositions and Sets}
\begin{thm}
 Every proposition is a set:
 $$\text{\emph{If} }\prod_{x,y:A}x=_A y\text{ \emph{then} }\prod_{x,y:A}\prod_{p,q:x=_A y}p=_{x=_A y} q$$
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
 Suppose $f:\prod x,y:A.x=_A y$. Given two inhabitants of $A$, $f$ returns a path between them.
 
 Fix $x_0:A$ and let $g \defeq f(x_0):\prod y:A.x_0=_A y$. For $p:y=_A y'$, we have 
 $$\apd_g(p): p_*(g(y)) =_{x_0=_A y'} g(y')$$
 
 and by property of transport within identity type,
 $$p_*(g(y))=_{x_0=_A y'} g(y)\cdot p.$$
 
 By transitivity, we thus have
 $$g(y)\cdot p =_{x_0=_A y'} g(y')$$
 $$p =_{x_0=_A y'} g(y)^{-1}\cdot g(y)$$
 
 For $q:y=_A y'$, these same calculations give us 
 $$q =_{x_0=_A y'} g(y)^{-1}\cdot g(y).$$
 
 Thus, $p =_{x_0=_A y'} q$ as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
 $\isProp(\isProp(A))$ -- that is, there is only one proof that $A$ has only one inhabitant.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
 Let $f,g:\isProp(A)$ be given. To show $f =_{\isProp(A)} g$, it suffices to show (by $\funext$)
 $x,y:A\entails \_: f x y =_{x=_A y} g x y$. This follows since $\isProp(A)\to \isSet(A)$.
\end{proof}

We can similarly prove $\isProp(\isSet(A))$. With the proper notion of $\mathsf{isEquiv}(A)(B)$,
we will be able to prove $\isProp(\mathsf{isEquiv}(A)(B))$; this will come later.


\section{Contractibility}
In preparation for what follows, we define the notion of contractibility:
$$\isContr(A):\sum_{x:A}\prod_{y:A}x=_A y$$

That is, a type is contractible if there is some inhabitant which all other
inhabitants are equal to. This is equivalent to saying that $A$ is a prop, and
it is inhabited. Alternatively, a $A$ type is contractibile if it is equivalent
to $1$. 

Notice that for any type $A$, given $a{:}A$, we have that $\isContr(\Sigma
x{:}A a = x)$. In particular, $\tuple{a}{\refl{A}(a))}$ is an inhabitant of
this type which all other elements are equal to.

\begin{figure}

   \draw (0, 0) ellipse (3cm and 3cm);

   \node [above] at (0 cm, 0cm) {$x$};

   \draw [fill] (-1.5 cm, 1.5cm) circle [radius=.05cm];

   \draw [double equal sign distance, shorten <= .25cm, shorten >= .25cm] (0cm, 0cm) -- (-1.5cm, -1.5cm);
   \draw [double equal sign distance, shorten <= .25cm, shorten >= .25cm] (0cm, 0cm) -- (-1.5cm, 1.5cm);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\caption{A contractible type. There is some element $x$, and paths between $x$ and all other elements}
\end{figure}

The notions of contraction and truncation are related to the (n)-type hierarchy: 
specifically, contractions sit at the bottom of the hierarchy. For historical reasons,
we begin with (-2) types, and define inductively:
\begin{align*}
 \isNtype{(-2)}(A)\defeq&\ \isContr(A) \\ %Better way to format this?
 \isNtype{(n+1)}(A)\defeq &\ \prod_{x,y:A}\isNtype{n}(x=_A y)
\end{align*}

Now, we have that: 

 $$\isProp(A)\leftrightarrow \prod_{x,y:A}\isContr(x=_A y).$$
which implies that
$$\isProp(A)\leftrightarrow \isNtype{(-1)}(A).$$

We can further prove the following:
\begin{align*}
 \isSet(A)\leftrightarrow &\ \isNtype{0}(A) \\
 \mathsf{isGpd}(A)\leftrightarrow &\ \isNtype{1}(A) \\
 \mathsf{is}\mbox{-}2\mbox{-}\mathsf{Gpd}(A)\leftrightarrow &\ \isNtype{2}(A) \\
 \vdots\ & 
\end{align*}

As well as
$$\prod_{A:\mathcal{U}}\left( \isNtype{n}(A)\to \isNtype{(n+1)}(A) \right).$$

However, it is \emph{not} the case that every type is an $n$-type for some $n$: consider $\mathcal{U}$.

\section{Propositional Truncation (Squashing)}
THIS SECTION NEEDS TO BE UPDATED FOR WEDNESDAY'S LECTURE.

The notion of ``squashing'' introduced last week was perhaps too heavy-handed: it was used toward
a number of goals, among them to recover classical logic within constructive logic. We now introduce
the more general idea of \emph{abstract truncation}, which for now will be taken as a primitive
idea of HoTT. Truncation serves to reduce types to sets, without all the byproducts of the double negation translation.

Let $\|A\|_{-1}$ be read as the \emph{(-1)-truncation} of $A$. When the context is clear, we omit
the subscript. We have the following $\|\cdot \|$-introduction rules:

\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[{\|\cdot\|}I]{|M|:\|A\|}{
    M:A}
  \and
  \infer[{\|\cdot\|}I]{\_: \Id{\|A\|}(|M|,|N|)}{
    M:A & N:A}
\end{mathpar}

And the elimination rule:
$$
  \infer[{\|\cdot\|}E]{\trunc(|M|; P; x.N):B}{
    M:\|A\| & x:A\entails N:B & P:\isProp(B)}
$$

The $\beta$ rule works as one might expect:
$$\trunc(|M|; P; x.N)\equiv [M/x]N$$

We require a proof of $\isProp(B)$ to ensure that the behavior of $N$ does not depend on the
representative $x:A$. There are other ways to ensure this property: for instance, we could instead
require $u,v:A\entails [u/x]N =_B [v/x]N$. Note that $\isProp(B)$ implies that this is the case.
