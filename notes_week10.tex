\section{Reconsider $\Nat$ in simple types}

As a warmup to discussing inductive types, we first review several equivalent
presentations of the simple type $\Nat$ seen earlier in the course. The
introduction form for $\Nat$ are $\z$ and $\s(M)$ for any $M: \Nat$.
The elimination form is the recursor $\rec$.

\subsection{Traditional Form}

\[
\begin{array}{c}

\infer[{\Nat}I_{z1}]{\ctx \entails \z : \Nat}{}

\qquad
\hfill

\infer[{\Nat}I_{s1}]{\ctx \entails \s(M) : \Nat}{\ctx \entails M: \Nat}

\\[4ex]

\infer[{\Nat}E_1]
{\ctx \entails \rec[A](M; M_0; x. M_1): A}
{\ctx \entails M : \Nat \qquad
\ctx \entails M_0 : A \qquad
\ctx, x: A \entails M_1 :A}

\end{array}
\]

We include the motive $A$ in the recursor to motivate the dependently-typed
presentation to come although it is not necessary in the simply-typed setting.
The dynamic behavior of $\rec$ is defined by the following $\beta$ rules.

\[\rec[A](\z; M_0; x. M_1) \jdeq M_0\]
\[\rec[A](\s(M); M_0; x. M_1) \jdeq [\rec[A](M; M_0; x. M_1)/x]M_1\]

The recursor on $\z$ returns the base case $M_0$. On $\s(M)$, it substitutes
the recursive result on $M$ for $x$ in $M_1$. The $\eta$ rule states that
any object that ``behaves like'' the recursor is definitionally equal to the
recursor on the appropriate arguments.

\[
\infer[\eta]
{\ctx, y: \Nat \entails N \jdeq \rec[A](y; M_0; x. M_1)}
{[0/x]N \jdeq M_0 \qquad
\ctx, z: \Nat \entails [\s(z)/x]N \jdeq [[z/y]N/x]M_1 : A}
\]

\subsection{Alternate Form}
The introduction and elimination rules can be presented in this alternate form:

\[
\begin{array}{c}
\cdot \entails \z : \Nat ({\Nat}I_{z2})

\qquad
\hfill

x: \Nat \entails \s(x) : \Nat ({\Nat}I_{s2})

\\[4ex]

M: \Nat, M_0: A, x: A, M_1
\end{array}
\]

%% TODO: Help!

\subsection{As elements of the exponential}
The introduction forms of $\Nat$ may be treated as exponentials in the absence
of a context.

\[\cdot \entails \z : 1 \to \Nat ({\Nat}I_{z3})\]
\[\cdot \entails \s : \Nat \to \Nat ({\Nat}I_{s3})\]

Note that the type $1 \to \Nat$ is equivalent to the type $\Nat$. There are
two ways to present the elimination form in this format. The first moves the
$\Nat$ on which the recursion is done to the argument position, implying that
$\rec$ has exponential type.

\[
\infer[{\Nat}E_{3a}]
{z: \Nat \entails \rec[A](M_0; x. M_1)(z)}
{\cdot \entails M_0: A \qquad x: A \entails M_1: A}
\]

This can be presented in a more direct way by ommitting the argument.

\[
\infer[{\Nat}E_{3b}]
{\cdot \entails \rec[A](M_0; x. M_1)(z)}
{\cdot \entails M_0: A \qquad x: A \entails M_1: A}
\]

As above, we can derive rules $\Nat I_{z1}$, $\Nat I_{s1}$ and $\Nat E_1$.
For example,

\[
\begin{array}{c}
\infer{\ctx, M: \Nat \entails \s(M) : \Nat}
{\infer{\ctx, M: \Nat \entails M: \Nat}{\strut} \qquad
\infer[\Nat I_{s3}]{\ctx, M: \Nat \entails \s : \Nat \to \Nat}{\strut}}
\end{array}
\]

\section{Nat-algebras}
We now motivate the idea of nat-algebras, %which are maps of the form
$1 + A \to A$. From the name, one would expect there to be a nat-algebra
where $A$ is $\Nat$. Indeed, there is.

\[z: 1 + \Nat \entails \case(z; \dummy. \z; x. \s(x)) : \Nat\]

We can write $\case(z; \dummy. \z; x. \s(x))$
above as $\{\dummy. \z; x. \s(x)\}(z)$ or, somewhat abusively,
$\{\z, \s\}(z)$. This gives

\[\cdot \entails \{\z, \s\} : 1 + \Nat \to \Nat\]

as desired. More generally, we can write any nat-algebra as
$\alpha = \{\alpha_0, \alpha_1\}$ where $\alpha_0 : 1 \to \Nat$ (or,
equivalently, $\alpha_0 : \Nat$) and $\alpha_1: \Nat \to \Nat$. We call
$\alpha_0$ the {\em basis} or {\em pseudo-zero} and $\alpha_1$ the
{\em inductive step} or {\em pseudo-successor}.

In fact, $\{\z, \s\}$ holds a special position among nat-algebras.
The nat-algebras form a category and $\{\z, \s\}$ is the initial object
in this category. Recall that this means it has a unique morphism to any other
object in the category. This requires us to define morphisms between
nat-algebras, which we will call {\em Nat homomorphisms}. Given two
nat-algebras, $\alpha : 1 + A \to A$ and $\beta: 1 + B \to B$,
$h: A \to B$ is a Nat homomorphism if it makes the following diagram commute.

\[
\begin{tikzcd}
1+A \arrow{d}{\alpha} \arrow{r}{1+h} & 1+B \arrow{d}{\beta}\\
A \arrow{r}{h} & B
\end{tikzcd}
\]

The map $1 + h: 1 + A \to 1 + B$ is defined in the natural way:

\[1 + h \defeq \{\dummy. \inl \triv; a. \inr h(a)\}\]

To show that $\Nat$ is an initial algebra, we must show that for every
nat-algebra
$\alpha: 1 + A \to A$, there exists a unique Nat homomorphism $!: \Nat \to A$
such that the following diagram commutes (note that the order of
quantifications expressed in the previous sentence is not inherently clear in
the diagram, and must be considered to get a full understanding of the
diagram.)

\[
\begin{tikzcd}
1+\Nat \arrow{d}{\{\z, \s\}} \arrow[dashed]{r}{1+!} & 1+A \arrow{d}{\alpha}\\
\Nat \arrow[dashed]{r}{!} & A
\end{tikzcd}
\]

Let's consider the requirements on $!$ for the diagram to commute.

\[! \z = \alpha_0 \]
\[! \s(x) = \alpha_1(! x)\]

where the left sides correspond to following the path $! \comp \{\z, \s\}$
and the right sides correspond to following $\alpha \comp 1 + !$. Note that
these two equations match the $\beta$ rules for $\rec$, so we can define
$! \defeq \rec[A](\alpha_0; \alpha_1)$ or simply $! \defeq \rec[A](\alpha)$.
As we see above, the $\beta$ rules for $\rec$ imply
commutation of the diagram. Uniqueness of $!$ follows from the $\eta$ rule
for $\rec$.

It's worth noting that commuting diagrams hide exactly the type of equality
that is being discussed, which is quite
important in HoTT. For $\Nat$, for example, uniqueness of $!$ holds ``on
the nose,'' while, in general, uniqueness may be only up to higher homotopy.

\section{$F$-algebras}
The above discussion can be generalized to any functor $F$. A functor is
a mapping between categories $C$ and $D$. Functors act on objects in a
category and the morphisms between them, i.e. for all objects $X \in C$,
$F(X) \in D$, and for all morphisms $f: X \to Y$ between objects $X$ and $Y$
in $C$, $F(f): F(X) \to F(Y)$. 
Functors respect identity and composition:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item For every object $X \in C$, $F(\id_X) = \id_{F(X)}$
  \item For all morphisms $f: X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to Z$, 
    $F(g\comp f) = F(g)\comp F(f)$
  \end{enumerate}
\cite{WikiFunctor}

For example, $F_{\Nat}(C) \defeq 1 + C$ is a functor. We check that $F_\Nat$
preserves identities and composition. Let $X$ be an object of $C$.
\[F_\Nat(\id_X) = 1 + \id_X = \{\triv, \id_X\}\]
which is indeed an identity
on $1 + X$. Let $f: X\to Y, g: Y \to Z$ be morphisms between objects of $C$.
\[F_\Nat(g \comp f) = 1 + g \comp f = \{\triv, g \comp f\} =
\{\triv, g\} \comp \{\triv, f\} = (1 + g) \comp (1 + f) = F(g) \comp F(f)\]

For any functor $F$, an $F$-algebra is a mapping $F(X) \to X$. Thus,
a nat-algebra is an $F_\Nat$-algebra. $F$-algebras form categories as
nat-algebras do. For a functor $F$, objects $A$ and $B$, two $F$-algebras
$\alpha: F(A) \to A$ and $\beta: F(B) \to B$, and a morphism $h: A \to B$,
the following diagram commutes.

\[
\begin{tikzcd}
F(A) \arrow{d}{\alpha} \arrow{r}{F(h)} & F(B) \arrow{d}{\beta}\\
A \arrow{r}{h} & B
\end{tikzcd}
\]

An {\em initial} $F$-algebra is an $F$-algebra $i: F(I) \to I$ such that
for all other $F$-algebras $\alpha: F(A) \to A$, there exists a unique map
$!: I \to A$ such that the following diagram commutes.

\[
\begin{tikzcd}
F(I) \arrow{d}{i} \arrow[dashed]{r}{F(!)} & F(A) \arrow{d}{\alpha}\\
I \arrow[dashed]{r}{!} & A
\end{tikzcd}
\]

There also exists the notion of an $F$-coalgebra, which, dual to the above,
is a map $\alpha: A \to F(A)$. A final $F$-coalgebra is a mapping 
$j: J \to F(J)$ such that for all other $F$-coalgebras $\alpha: A \to F(A)$,
there exists a unique map $!: A \to J$ making the following diagram commute.

\[
\begin{tikzcd}
A \arrow{d}{\alpha} \arrow[dashed]{r}{!} & J \arrow{d}{j}\\
F(A) \arrow[dashed]{r}{!} & J
\end{tikzcd}
\]

\begin{lemma}[Lambek]
If $i: F(I) \to I$ is an initial $F$-algebra, then $i$ is an isomorphism.
That is, $F(I) \equiv I$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
To show that $i$ is an isomorphism, we must exhibit an inverse
$i^{-1}: I \to F(I)$
such that $i \comp i^{-1} = \id_I$ and $i^{-1} \comp i = \id_{F(I)}$.
Consider the $F$-algebra $F(i): F(F(I)) \to F(I)$. We now treat $i$ as
homomorphism between the $F$-algebras $F(i)$ and $i$ making this diagram
commute.

\[
\begin{tikzcd}
F(F(I)) \arrow{d}{F(i)} \arrow{r}{F(i)} & F(I) \arrow{d}{i}\\
F(I) \arrow{r}{i} & I
\end{tikzcd}
\]

Since $i$ is an initial $F$-algebra, however, we also have a unique mapping
$!: I \to F(I)$ making the top half of this diagram commute.
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
F(I) \arrow[dashed]{d}{F(!)} \arrow{r}{i} & I \arrow[dashed]{d}{!}\\
F(F(I)) \arrow{d}{F(i)} \arrow{r}{F(i)} & F(I) \arrow{d}{i}\\
F(I) \arrow{r}{i} & I
\end{tikzcd}
\]

There is also a unique mapping from $I$ to $I$, which must be the identity.
This indicates that the mapping $i \comp !$ along the right side of the
diagram must be equal to $\id_I$:

\[i \comp ! = \id_I\]

We also have
\[! \comp i = F(i) \comp F(!) = F(i \comp !) = F(\id_I) = \id_{F(I)}\]
where the first equality follows from the commutativity of the upper half of
the diagram, the second and fourth follow from the properties of functors
and the third follows from the result above.
\end{proof}

This shows that for any functor $F$, the initial $F$-algebra $I$ is a fixed
point of $F$. A dual result can be proven showing that, if $J$ is the final 
$F$-coalgebra of a functor $F$, then $F(J) \equiv J$.
