\section{Paths-over-Paths}\label{}

Recall that last time we explored the higher groupoid structure of types, and
showed that for non-dependent maps, $\ap$ preserves this structure.  Now, in
the case where we have a dependent function $f : \Pi x: A.B$, we would like to
similarly state that $f$ maps equals to equals, so that given a path $p :
\Id{A}(M,N)$, there is some map which takes $p$ gives a path between $f M$ and
$f N$. However, because $f$ is dependent, $f M : [M/x]B$ and $f N : [N/x] B$.
Although these types are related, they are not equal, so we cannot talk about
propositional equality between $f M$ and $f N$.

In earlier lectures, we defined $\tr[x.B]p : [M/x] B \to [N/x] B$, often
written as $p_*$, which lifts the path $p$ to a mapping between the fibers
$[M/x] B$ and $[N/x] B$. Since $p_*(f M)$ and $f N$ share the same type, we can
meaningfully talk about equality between them. We can now define a map $\apd_f
: \Pi p: \Id{A}(M, N). \Id{[N/x]B}(p_* (f M), f N)$ by
%
\[ \apd_f p := \J[m.n.z. \Id{[n/x]B}(z_{*}(f m), f n)](p ; m. \refl{[m/x]B}(m)) \]
%

This has the appropriate type because when the path is simply $\refl{A}(M)$, we
have that $(\refl{A}(M))_* \jdeq \refl{[M/x]B}(f M)$ Now, since $p_*^{-1}$
gives a map between the fibers going the other way, we could just as well have
defined an analogous term $\apd_f' : Id{A}(M, N) \to \Id{[M/x]B}(f M,
p_*^{-1}(f N))$. Moreover, we have that
%
\[
\begin{array}{lcl}
\ap_{p_*^{-1}} (\apd_f p) &:& \Id{[M/x]B}(p_*^{-1} (p_* (f M)), p_*^{-1} (f N))  \\
                          & &  \ \ \jdeq \Id{[M/x]B}(f M, p_*^{-1} (f N)) \\
\\
\ap_{p_*} (\apd_f p^{-1}) &:& \Id{[N/x]B}(p_* (f M)), p_* (p_*^{-1} (f N))) \\
                          & &  \ \ \jdeq \Id{[N/x]B}(p_* (f M), f N) \\

\end{array}
\]
%
which shows that these two theorems imply one another. 

The lack of symmetry in the types of $\apd_f$ and $\apd_f'$ is somewhat awkward
when developing machine checked proofs. It's more convenient to define a
symmetric notation, $f(M) =_p^{x. B} f(N) \defeq Id{[N/x]B}(p_* (f M), f N)$,
which we read as ``$f(M)$ and $f(N)$ are correlated by $p$" . This corresponds
to the type of paths \emph{over} the path $p$. Using this notation, we 
can prove theorems about this type like:


\[
\begin{array}{lcl}
\text{sym}_{\text{corr}} & : & Q =_p^{x.B} R \ \to \ R =_{p^{-1}}^{x.B} Q \\
\\
\text{trans}_{\text{corr}} & : & Q =_p^{x.B} R \ \to R =_q^{x.B} S \to Q =_{p \concat q}^{x.B} S 
\end{array}
\]
