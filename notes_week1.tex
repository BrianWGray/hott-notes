\section{Contents}\label{sec:contents}

These notes summarize the lectures on \HoTT\ (HoTT) given by Professor Robert Harper on
September 9 and 11, 2013, at CMU.  They start by providing a introduction to HoTT, capturing
its main ideas and its connection to other related type theories.  Then they present
Intuitionistic Propositional Logic (IPL), giving both an inference-rule-based formulation as
well an order-theoretic formulation.  The notes conclude with a brief summary.

\section{Introduction to \HoTT\ (HoTT)}\label{sec:intro}

\subsection{In a Nutshell}\label{subsec:hott_in_nutshell}

The notion of proof relevance requires us to draw a fine distinction between the proofs given
in a intuitionistic logic and the ones given in conventional mathematics.
Harper~\cite{Harper2012} calls the former \textbf{proofs} and the latter \textbf{formal
  proofs}.  Formal proofs arise from the application of the inductively defined rules in a
fixed formal system.  According to G\"{o}del's Incompleteness Theorem, however, we know that
there are certain propositions that are true for which there is no formal proof.  Thus, an
intuitionistic approach defeats the adoption of a formal proof since in intuitionism true
propositions are only those for which there exists a proof.

According to Harper~\cite{Harper2013a,Harper2013}, HoTT:

\begin{itemize}

\item is a nice way to phrase arguments in homotopy theory that avoids some of the technicalities
  in the classical proofs by treating spaces and paths \textbf{synthetically}, rather than
  \textbf{analytically}

\item is a good language for \textbf{mechanization} of mathematics that provides for the concise
  formulation of proofs in a form that can be verified by a computer

\item points the way towards a vast extension of the concept of computation that enables us to
  \textbf{compute with abstract geometric objects} such as spheres or toruses

\item is a new \textbf{foundation for mathematics} that subsumes set theory by generalizing
  types from mere sets to arbitrary infinity groupoids, sets being but particularly simple
  types (those with no non-trivial higher-dimensional structure).

\end{itemize}

HoTT's most distinctive feature is its \textbf{constructivity}.

\subsection{In Type Theory Context}\label{subsec:type_theory_context}

Extensional Type Theory (ETT).  There is the conception that ETT is ``wrong''~\cite{Harper2012}
because the typing judgement is not decidable.

\section{Intuitionistic Propositional Logic: ``Logic as if people matter''}\label{sec:ipl}

% [COMMENT_SB:] Explain difference between introduction and elimination rules.  Mention
% Gentzen's rule of inversion.

\newacronym{IPL}{IPL}{intuitionistic propositional logic}%
%
As advanced by Per Martin-L\"{o}f, a modern presentation of \gls{IPL} distinguishes the notions of \vocab{judgement} and \vocab{proposition}.
A judgment is something that may be known, whereas a proposition is something that sensibly be may the subject of a judgment.
For instance, 

% Ultimately, we are interested in judging the truth, or provability, of a proposition.
% But first, 

Thus, in \gls{IPL}, the two most basic judgements are $A \prop$ and $A \true$:


\subsection{Negative fragment of \gls{IPL}}\label{sec:ipl-negative}

\subsubsection{Truth}\label{sec:truth}

One of the simplest propositions is \vocab{truth}, which we write as $\truth$.
Its formation rule serves as immediate evidence of the judgment $\truth \prop$, that $\truth$ is indeed a well-formed proposition.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\truth}F]{\truth \prop}{
    }
\end{equation*}

We have yet to give meaning to truth, however; to do so, we must say what counts as a verification of $\truth$.
The proposition $\truth$ is trivially true, and so its introduction rule makes the judgment $\truth \true$ immediately evident.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\truth}I]{\truth \true}{
    }
\end{equation*}

We should also pause to consider an elimination rule for $\truth$: from a proof of $\truth \true$, what can we deduce?
Since $\truth$ is trivially true, any such elimination rule would not increase our knowledge---we put in no information when we introduced $\truth \true$, so, by the principle of conservation of proof, we should get no information out.
For this reason, there is no elimination rule for $\truth$.

To summarize, here are the formation, introduction, and elimination rules for truth:
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[{\truth}F]{\truth \prop}{
    }
  \\
  \infer[{\truth}I]{\truth \true}{
    }
  \and
  \text{(no ${\truth}E$ rule)}
\end{mathpar}

\subsubsection{Conjunction}\label{sec:conjunction}

Another familiar group of propositions are the conjunctions.
If $A$ and $B$ are propositions, then so is their conjunction, which we write as $A \conj B$.
This is the content of the formation rule for conjunction.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\conj}F]{A \conj B \prop}{
    A \prop & B \prop}
\end{equation*}

To give meaning to conjunction, we must say what counts as a verification of $A \conj B$.
This is done by the following introduction rule, which shows that a verification of $A \conj B$ consists of a verification of $A$ paired with a verification of $B$.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\conj}I]{A \conj B \true}{
    A \true & B \true}
\end{equation*}

On the flip side, what may we deduce from the knowledge that $A \conj B$ is true?
Because is a pair of verifications of $A$ and $B$, we are justified in deducing $A \true$ and $B \true$.
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[{\conj}E_1]{A \true}{
    A \conj B \true}
  \and
  \infer[{\conj}E_2]{B \true}{
    A \conj B \true}
\end{mathpar}
