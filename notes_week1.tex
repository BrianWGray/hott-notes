\section{Contents}\label{sec:contents}

These notes summarize the lectures on Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) given by Professor Robert
Harper on September 9 and 11, 2013, at CMU.  They start by providing a introduction to HoTT,
capturing its main ideas and its connection to other related type theories.  Then they present
Intuitionistic Propositional Logic (IPL), giving both an inference-rule-based formulation as
well an order-theoretic formulation.  The notes conclude with a brief summary.

% [COMMENT_SB:] How does IPL relate to HoTT?

\section{Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory}\label{sec:intro}

\newacronym{HoTT}{HoTT}{Homotopy Type Theory}%
%
\gls{HoTT} is the subject of a very active research community that gathered at the Institute
for Advanced Study (IAS) in 2012 to participate in the Univalent Foundations Program.  The
results of the program have been recently published in the HoTT Book~\cite{HoTTBook2013}.

\subsection{HoTT in a nutshell}\label{subsec:hott_in_nutshell}

\gls{HoTT} is based on Per Martin-L\"{o}fs Intuitionistic Type Theory, which provides a
foundation for \emph{intuitionistic mathematics} and which is an extension of \emph{Brouwer's
  program}.  Brouwer viewed mathematical reasoning as a human activity and mathematics as a
language for communicating mathematical concepts.  As a result, Brouwer perceives the ability
of executing a step-by-step procedure or algorithm for performing a \emph{construction} as a
fundamental human faculty.

Adopting Brouwer's constructive viewpoint, intuitionistic theories view proofs as the
fundamental forms of construction.  The notion of \emph{proof relevance} is thus a
characteristic feature of an intuitionistic (or constructive\footnote{In this course,
  intuitionism and constructivism are used interchangeably.}) approach.  In the context of
\gls{HoTT}, proof relevance means that proofs become mathematical objects~\cite{Harper2013}.
To fully understand this standpoint, it is necessary to draw a distinction between the notion
of a \emph{proof} and the one of a \emph{formal proof}~\cite{Harper2013,Harper2012}.  A formal
proof is a proof given in a fixed formal system, such as the axiomatic theory of sets, that
arises from the application of the inductively defined rules in that system.  Whereas every
formal proof is also a proof (assuming soundness of the system) the converse is not true.  This
fact immediately follows from G\"{o}del's Incompleteness Theorem, which precisely states that
there exist true propositions, for which there exist a proof, but for which there cannot be
given a formal proof, using the rules of the formal system.

Unlike conventional formally defined systems, \gls{HoTT}  does not surmise that all possible
proofs can be fully circumscribed by the rules of the formal system.  In addition to formal
proofs, \gls{HoTT} accepts proofs that may actually 

Proofs of equality correspond to paths in a space.

According to Harper~\cite{Harper2013a,Harper2013}, HoTT:

\begin{itemize}

\item is a nice way to phrase arguments in homotopy theory that avoids some of the technicalities
  in the classical proofs by treating spaces and paths \emph{synthetically}, rather than
  \emph{analytically}

\item is a good language for \emph{mechanization} of mathematics that provides for the concise
  formulation of proofs in a form that can be verified by a computer

\item points the way towards a vast extension of the concept of computation that enables us to
  \emph{compute with abstract geometric objects} such as spheres or toruses

\item is a new \emph{foundation for mathematics} that subsumes set theory by generalizing
  types from mere sets to arbitrary infinity groupoids, sets being but particularly simple
  types (those with no non-trivial higher-dimensional structure).

\end{itemize}

HoTT's most distinctive feature is its \emph{constructivity}.

\subsection{HoTT in type theory context}\label{subsec:type_theory_context}

Extensional Type Theory (ETT).  There is the conception that ETT is ``wrong''~\cite{Harper2012}
because the typing judgement is not decidable.

\section{Intuitionistic propositional logic: ``Logic as if people matter''}\label{sec:ipl}

% [COMMENT_SB:] Explain difference between introduction and elimination rules.  Mention
% Gentzen's rule of inversion.

What is meant by \emph{intuitionistic} logic?  One might say its slogan is ``logic as if people matter'', alluding to Brouwer's principle that mathematics is a social process.

\newacronym{IPL}{IPL}{intuitionistic propositional logic}%
%
As advanced by Per Martin-L\"{o}f, a modern presentation of \gls{IPL} distinguishes the notions of \vocab{judgment} and \vocab{proposition}.
A judgment is something that may be known, whereas a proposition is something that sensibly be may the subject of a judgment.
For instance, 

% [COMMENT_SB:] In the lecture this was called internal coherence rather than harmony, right?

The principle of harmony is that the introduction and elimination rules for a proposition $A$ fit together properly.  The elimination rules should be strong enough to deduce all information that was used to introduce $A$ (\vocab{local completeness}), but not so strong as to deduce information that might not have been used to introduce $A$ (\vocab{local soundness}).  In a later lecture, we will discuss harmony more precisely, but we can already give an informal treatment.

% Ultimately, we are interested in judging the truth, or provability, of a proposition.
% But first, 

Thus, in \gls{IPL}, the two most basic judgements are $A \prop$ and $A \true$:


\subsection{Negative fragment of \gls{IPL}}\label{sec:ipl-negative}

\subsubsection{Conjunction}\label{sec:conjunction}

One familiar group of propositions are the conjunctions.
If $A$ and $B$ are well-formed propositions, then so is their conjunction, which we write as $A \conj B$.
The formation rule for conjunction serves as evidence of the judgement $A \conj B \prop$, that $A \conj B$ is a well-formed proposition, provided that there is evidence of the judgements $A \prop$ and $B \prop$.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\conj}F]{A \conj B \prop}{
    A \prop & B \prop}
\end{equation*}

We have yet to give meaning to conjunction, however; to do so, we must say how to introduce the judgement that $A \conj B$ is \emph{true}.
As the following rule shows, a verification of $A \conj B$ consists of a proof of $A \true$ paired with a proof of $B \true$.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\conj}I]{A \conj B \true}{
    A \true & B \true}
\end{equation*}

What may we deduce from the knowledge that $A \conj B$ is true?
Because every proof of $A \conj B \true$ ultimately introduces that judgement from a pair of proofs of $A \true$ and $B \true$, we are justified in deducing $A \true$ and $B \true$ from any proof of $A \conj B \true$.
This leads to the elimination rules for conjunction.
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[{\conj}E_1]{A \true}{
    A \conj B \true}
  \and
  \infer[{\conj}E_2]{B \true}{
    A \conj B \true}
\end{mathpar}

\paragraph{Harmony.}\label{sec:conj-harmony}
As previously mentioned, the principle of harmony says that the introduction and elimination rules fit together properly: the elimination rules are strong enough, but not too strong.

If we mistakenly omitted the ${\conj}E_2$ elimination rule, then there would be no way to
extract the proof of $B \true$ that was used in introducing $A \conj B \true$---the elimination
rules would be too weak.

On the other hand, if we mistakenly wrote the ${\conj}I$ introduction rule as
\begin{equation*}
  \infer{A \conj B \true}{
    A \true} \,,
\end{equation*}
then there would be no proof of $B \true$ present to justify deducing $B \true$ with the ${\conj}E_2$ rule---the elimination rules would be too strong.

\subsubsection{Truth}\label{sec:truth}

Another familiar and simple proposition is \vocab{truth}, which we write as $\truth$.
Its formation rule serves as immediate evidence of the judgment $\truth \prop$, that $\truth$ is indeed a well-formed proposition.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\truth}F]{\truth \prop}{
    }
\end{equation*}

Once again, to give meaning to truth we must say how to introduce the judgement that $\truth$ is true.
$\truth$ is a trivially true proposition, and so its introduction rule makes the judgment $\truth \true$ immediately evident.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\truth}I]{\truth \true}{
    }
\end{equation*}

We should also consider an elimination rule: from a proof of $\truth \true$, what can we deduce?
Since $\truth$ is trivially true, any such elimination rule would not increase our knowledge---we put in no information when we introduced $\truth \true$, so, by the principle of conservation of proof, we should get no information out.
For this reason, there is no elimination rule for $\truth$, and we can see that its absence harmonizes with the introduction rule.

\paragraph{Nullary conjuction.}\label{sec:nullary-conjuction}
An observation about $\truth$ that often proves useful is that $\truth$ behaves as a nullary conjunction---a conjunction over the empty set of conjuncts, rather than over a set of two conjuncts.

This observation is reflected in the inference rules.
Just as the introduction rule for binary conjunction has two premises (one for each of the two conjuncts), the introduction rule for truth has no premises (one for each of the no conjuncts):
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[{\conj}I]{A \conj B \true}{
    A \true & B \true}
  \and
  \infer[{\truth}I]{\truth \true}{
    }
\end{mathpar}
Likewise, just as there are two elimination rules for binary conjunction, there are no elimination rules for truth:
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[{\conj}E_1]{A \true}{
    A \conj B \true}
  \and
  \infer[{\conj}E_2]{B \true}{
    A \conj B \true}
  \and\and
  \text{(no ${\truth}E$ rule)}
\end{mathpar}

\subsubsection{Entailment}\label{sec:entailment}

The last form of proposition in the negative fragment of \gls{IPL} is implication.
However, to define implication, a different form of judgment is required: entailment (also known as logical consequence or a hypothetical judgment).
Entailment is written
\begin{equation*}
  \underbrace{A_1 \true, \dotsc, A_n \true}_{n \geq 0} \entails A \true \,,
\end{equation*}
and is intended to express the idea that the judgment $A \true$ follows from $A_1 \true, \dotsc, A_n \true$.
You can think of $A_1 \true, \dotsc, A_n \true$ as being assumptions from which the conclusion $A \true$ may be deduced.
The metavariable $\ctx$ is typically used to stand for such a collection of assumptions.

As an entailment, the judgment form satisfies several properties: reflexivity, transitivity, weakening, contraction, and permutation.

\paragraph{Reflexivity.}\label{sec:reflexivity}
If this judgment is to express logical consequence, that is, that this conclusion follows from those assumptions, then you must accept a principle of reflexivity,
\begin{equation*}
  A \true \entails A \true \,,
\end{equation*}
that an assumption is enough to conclude the same judgment.

\paragraph{Transitivity.}\label{sec:transitivity}


\subsubsection{Implication}\label{sec:implication}

\subsubsection{Summary of the negative fragment of \gls{IPL}}\label{sec:summary-negative}

\subsection{Positive fragment of \gls{IPL}}\label{sec:positive}

\subsubsection{Disjunction}\label{sec:disjunction}

As for conjunction and implication, the disjunction, $A \disj B$, of $A$ and $B$ is a well-formed proposition if both $A$ and $B$ are themselves well-formed propositions.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\disj}F]{A \disj B \prop}{
    A \prop & B \prop}
\end{equation*}

A disjunction $A \disj B$ may be introduced in either of two ways: $A \disj B$ is true if $A$ is true or if $B$ is true.
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[{\disj}I_1]{A \disj B \true}{
    A \true}
  \and
  \infer[{\disj}I_2]{A \disj B \true}{
    B \true}
\end{mathpar}
To devise the elimination rule, consider what may we deduce from the knowledge that $A \disj B$ is true.
For $A \disj B$ to be true, it must have been ultimately introduced using one of the two introduction rules.
Therefore, either $A$ or $B$ is true (or possibly both).
The elimination rule allows us to reason by these two cases: If $C \true$ follows from $A \true$ and also follows from $B \true$, then $C$ is true in either case.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\disj}E]{C \true}{
    A \disj B \true &
    A \true \entails C \true & B \true \entails C \true}
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Falsehood}\label{sec:falsehood}

The unit of disjunction is falsehood, the proposition that is trivially never true, which we write as $\falsehood$.  Its formation rule is immediate evidence that $\falsehood$ is a well-formed proposition.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\falsehood}F]{\falsehood \prop}{
    }
\end{equation*}

Because $\falsehood$ should never be true, it has no introduction rule.
The elimination rule captures \latin{ex falso quodlibet}: from a proof of $\falsehood \true$, we may deduce that \emph{any} proposition $C$ is true because there is ultimately no way to introduce $\falsehood \true$.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\falsehood}E]{C \true}{
    \falsehood \true}
\end{equation*}

Once again, the rules are in harmony.
The elimination rule is very strong, but remains justified due to the absence of any introduction rule for falsehood.

\paragraph{Nullary disjunction.}\label{sec:nullary-disjunction}
We previously noted that $\truth$ behaves as a nullary conjunction.
In the same way, $\falsehood$ behaves as a nullary disjunction.
For a binary disjunction, there are two introduction rules, ${\disj}I_1$ and ${\disj}I_2$, one for each of the two disjuncts; for falsehood, there are no introduction rules:
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[{\disj}I_1]{A \disj B \true}{
    A \true}
  \and
  \infer[{\disj}I_2]{A \disj B \true}{
    B \true}
  \and
  \text{(no ${\falsehood}I$ rule)}
\end{mathpar}
Likewise, for a binary disjunction, there is one elimination rule with a premise for the disjunction and one premise for each of the disjuncts; for falsehood, there is one elimination rule with just a premise for falsehood:
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[{\disj}E]{C \true}{
    A \disj B \true &
    A \true \entails C \true & B \true \entails C \true}
  \and
  \infer[{\falsehood}E]{C \true}{
    \falsehood \true}
\end{mathpar}
