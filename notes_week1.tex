\section{Intuitionistic Propositional Logic: ``Logic as if people matter''}\label{sec:ipl}

\newacronym{IPL}{IPL}{intuitionistic propositional logic}%
%
As advanced by Per Martin-L\"{o}f, a modern presentation of \gls{IPL} distinguishes the notions of \vocab{judgement} and \vocab{proposition}.
A judgment is something that may be known, whereas a proposition is something that sensibly be may the subject of a judgment.
For instance, 

% Ultimately, we are interested in judging the truth, or provability, of a proposition.
% But first, 

Thus, in \gls{IPL}, the two most basic judgements are $A \prop$ and $A \true$:


\subsection{Negative fragment of \gls{IPL}}\label{sec:ipl-negative}

\subsubsection{Truth}\label{sec:truth}

One of the simplest propositions is \vocab{truth}, which we write as $\truth$.
Its formation rule serves as immediate evidence of the judgment $\truth \prop$, that $\truth$ is indeed a well-formed proposition.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\truth}F]{\truth \prop}{
    }
\end{equation*}

We have yet to give meaning to truth, however; to do so, we must say what counts as a verification of $\truth$.
The proposition $\truth$ is trivially true, and so its introduction rule makes the judgment $\truth \true$ immediately evident.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\truth}I]{\truth \true}{
    }
\end{equation*}

We should also pause to consider an elimination rule for $\truth$: from a proof of $\truth \true$, what can we deduce?
Since $\truth$ is trivially true, any such elimination rule would not increase our knowledge---we put in no information when we introduced $\truth \true$, so, by the principle of conservation of proof, we should get no information out.
For this reason, there is no elimination rule for $\truth$.

To summarize, here are the formation, introduction, and elimination rules for truth:
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[{\truth}F]{\truth \prop}{
    }
  \\
  \infer[{\truth}I]{\truth \true}{
    }
  \and
  \text{(no ${\truth}E$ rule)}
\end{mathpar}

\subsubsection{Conjunction}\label{sec:conjunction}

Another familiar group of propositions are the conjunctions.
If $A$ and $B$ are propositions, then so is their conjunction, which we write as $A \conj B$.
This is the content of the formation rule for conjunction.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\conj}F]{A \conj B \prop}{
    A \prop & B \prop}
\end{equation*}

To give meaning to conjunction, we must say what counts as a verification of $A \conj B$.
This is done by the following introduction rule, which shows that a verification of $A \conj B$ consists of a verification of $A$ paired with a verification of $B$.
\begin{equation*}
  \infer[{\conj}I]{A \conj B \true}{
    A \true & B \true}
\end{equation*}

On the flip side, what may we deduce from the knowledge that $A \conj B$ is true?
Because is a pair of verifications of $A$ and $B$, we are justified in deducing $A \true$ and $B \true$.
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[{\conj}E_1]{A \true}{
    A \conj B \true}
  \and
  \infer[{\conj}E_2]{B \true}{
    A \conj B \true}
\end{mathpar}
