\section{Contents}\label{sec:contents}

These notes summarize the lectures on \HoTT\ (HoTT) given by Professor Robert Harper on
September 9 and 11, 2013, at CMU.  They start by providing a introduction to HoTT, capturing
its main ideas and its connection to other related type theories.  Then they present
Intuitionistic Propositional Logic (IPL), giving both an inference-rule-based formulation as
well an order-theoretic formulation.  The notes conclude with a brief summary.

% [COMMENT_SB:] How does IPL relate to HoTT?

\section{Introduction to \HoTT\ (HoTT)}\label{sec:intro}

\subsection{In a Nutshell}\label{subsec:hott_in_nutshell}

The notion of proof relevance requires us to draw a fine distinction between the proofs given
in a intuitionistic logic and the ones given in conventional mathematics.
Harper~\cite{Harper2012} calls the former \textbf{proofs} and the latter \textbf{formal
  proofs}.  Formal proofs arise from the application of the inductively defined rules in a
fixed formal system.  According to G\"{o}del's Incompleteness Theorem, however, we know that
there are certain propositions that are true for which there is no formal proof.  Thus, an
intuitionistic approach defeats the adoption of a formal proof since in intuitionism true
propositions are only those for which there exists a proof.

According to Harper~\cite{Harper2013a,Harper2013}, HoTT:

\begin{itemize}

\item is a nice way to phrase arguments in homotopy theory that avoids some of the technicalities
  in the classical proofs by treating spaces and paths \textbf{synthetically}, rather than
  \textbf{analytically}

\item is a good language for \textbf{mechanization} of mathematics that provides for the concise
  formulation of proofs in a form that can be verified by a computer

\item points the way towards a vast extension of the concept of computation that enables us to
  \textbf{compute with abstract geometric objects} such as spheres or toruses

\item is a new \textbf{foundation for mathematics} that subsumes set theory by generalizing
  types from mere sets to arbitrary infinity groupoids, sets being but particularly simple
  types (those with no non-trivial higher-dimensional structure).

\end{itemize}

HoTT's most distinctive feature is its \textbf{constructivity}.

\subsection{In Type Theory Context}\label{subsec:type_theory_context}

Extensional Type Theory (ETT).  There is the conception that ETT is ``wrong''~\cite{Harper2012}
because the typing judgement is not decidable.

\section{Intuitionistic Propositional Logic (IPL)}\label{sec:ipl}

\subsection{Inference-Rule-Based Formulation}\label{subsec:ipl_rules}

% [COMMENT_SB:] Explain difference between introduction and elimination rules.  Mention
% Gentzen's rule of inversion.

\subsubsection{Negative Fragment}\label{subsubsec:ipl_negfrag}

\subsubsection{Positive Fragment}\label{subsubsec:ipl_posfrag}

\subsection{Order-Theoretic Formulation}\label{subsec:ipl_order}

\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary}

% \section{Example Formulae}

% This is a paragraph with no purpose other than
% occupying some space.

% \begin{mathpar}
%     \infer*[Right=Reflection]{
%       \G \entails \bot \to \bot
%     }{
%       \G \entails \top \to \top
%     }
%     \\
%     \infer*[]{
%     }{
%       \G \entails \fst(\trans{p}{x}) \concat z \jdeq y : A
%     }
% \end{mathpar}

% The above rule is as insightful as this paragraph.
